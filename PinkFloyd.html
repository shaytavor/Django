        Roger Waters met Nick Mason while they were both studying architecture at the London Polytechnic
        at Regent Street. They first played music together in a group formed by Keith Noble and 
        Clive Metcalfe with Noble's sister Sheilagh. Richard Wright, a fellow architecture student,
        joined later that year, and the group became a sextet named Sigma 6. Waters played lead guitar, 
        Mason drums, and Wright rhythm guitar (since there was rarely an available keyboard).
        The band performed at private functions and rehearsed in a tearoom in the basement of the Regent 
        Street Polytechnic. They performed songs by the Searchers and material written by their manager 
        and songwriter, fellow student Ken Chapman.

        In September 1963, Waters and Mason moved into a flat at 39 Stanhope Gardens near Crouch End in 
        London, owned by Mike Leonard, a part-time tutor at the nearby Hornsey College of Art and the 
        Regent Street Polytechnic. Mason moved out after the 1964 academic year, and guitarist Bob Klose 
        moved in during September 1964, prompting Waters' switch to bass. Sigma 6 went through several 
        names, including the Meggadeaths, the Abdabs and the Screaming Abdabs, Leonard's Lodgers, and the 
        Spectrum Five, before settling on the Tea Set. In 1964, as Metcalfe and Noble left to form their 
        own band, guitarist Syd Barrett joined Klose and Waters at Stanhope Gardens. Barrett, two years 
        younger, had moved to London in 1962 to study at the Camberwell College of Arts.
        Waters and Barrett were childhood friends; Waters had often visited Barrett and watched him play 
        guitar at Barrett's mother's house. Mason said about Barrett: "In a period when everyone was being 
        cool in a very adolescent, self-conscious way, Syd was unfashionably outgoing; my enduring memory 
        of our first encounter is the fact that he bothered to come up and introduce himself to me."
